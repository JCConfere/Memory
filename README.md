## Instructions

Welcome to the game of Memory!  The rules of the game are as follows.  To begin the game
click on any two cards, which will reveal the symbols upon them, and see if you have a match! This will start the timer and the move counter. If the cards match, the cards will change color, and stay visible on the screen.  If they do not match, they'll flip over in 1 second, and you get to go again.  But be warned!  The more moves it takes you to win the game, the less stars you'll have at the finish!
